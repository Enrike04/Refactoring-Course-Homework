# Task 2/2: Extract magic numbers

### Task

To calculate the **energy of a photon**, we use a simple formula: multiply the Planck constant, which is a very small
number (`6.62607015 × 10^-34`), by the light's frequency (the number of waves that pass a point in one second). To find
the frequency of light, divide the speed of light (which is `299,792,458` meters per second) by the wave length of
the light. The greater the frequency, the higher the energy of the photon.

To calculate the **mass of a photon**, take the energy of the photon and divide it by the speed of
light squared. However, in practice, photons are considered to have zero mass.

In this task, you need to identify magic numbers in the code and create constant values for them.

<div class="hint" title="Speed of light">

_The speed of light_ is the ultimate speed limit in the universe, and it's a constant, never changing.
It's so fast that light can zip around the Earth over 7 times in just one second! And nothing can go faster than that.
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Planck constant">

_The Planck constant_ is a tiny constant that sets the scale for how energy and frequency are related in quantum
mechanics.
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Wave length">

_Wave length_ is like measuring how long one wave is, from the top of one wave to the top of the next wave.
It's not always the same size and can change depending on the type of wave or how it's made.
