You've completed the **Introduction to IDE Code Refactoring in Kotlin** course.
You've dived into the art of enhancing code quality, improving software design, and mastering techniques
to make your codebase more readable, maintainable, and flexible.

As you continue on your programming journey, here are a few recommended next steps:
- **Practice makes perfect**: Keep refining your skills by applying the concepts you've learned to real-world projects. The more you refactor and apply design patterns, the more intuitive and effective these techniques will become.
- **Explore advanced patterns**: While this course introduced you to several fundamental design patterns, there are many more out there waiting for you to explore. Patterns like Observer, Singleton, and Decorator are just a few examples. Dive into resources and books dedicated to design patterns to expand your knowledge.
- **Read widely**: Stay curious and keep reading articles, blogs, and books on software development, best practices, and emerging technologies.
