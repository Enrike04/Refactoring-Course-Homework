Let’s try to implement a Facade pattern to encapsulate the interactions between different classes.

Let’s take a look at the example in the editor. 

There are four classes `VideoLoader`, `VideoProcessor`, `VideoEncoder`,  and `VideoSaver`.
In the `main` method, we create an object of each class and invoke some methods.

Overall, the code lacks a clean interface for the client to interact with the system, which can lead to maintenance challenges.
This is where the **Facade** design pattern can help by **providing a higher-level interface** and encapsulating the system's complexity.
