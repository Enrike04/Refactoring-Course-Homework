# Task 1/1: Strategy Pattern â€“ Theory

The **Strategy** is a _behavioral pattern_ that allows you to define a family of algorithms,
encapsulate each algorithm, and make them interchangeable.
This pattern enables you to choose an appropriate algorithm at runtime without affecting the client code that uses it.

**When to apply the Strategy pattern?** \
Apply the Strategy pattern when you have multiple algorithms or strategies that can be used interchangeably within a class.
