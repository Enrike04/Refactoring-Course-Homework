# Task 1/1: Design patterns and their relationship with refactoring

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that software developers face during the design and
implementation of their applications. 
They offer a structured approach to solving specific issues and guide developers in creating maintainable, 
extensible, and robust software architectures.

Here is a list of advantages of design patterns:
- **Modularity**: Design patterns promote modular and organized code structure, making it easier to maintain complex systems.
- **Readability**: Design patterns enhance code readability by providing a consistent structure that other developers can easily understand.
- **Code Reusability**: Patterns can be reused across different places in the codebase, saving time and effort in solving similar design challenges.

Design patterns are categorized into three main types: creational, structural, and behavioral.
- **Creational patterns**: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, abstracting the instantiation process and making it more flexible. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype patterns.
- **Structural patterns**: Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects, emphasizing how objects are connected to form larger structures. Examples include Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy patterns.
- **Behavioral patterns**: Behavioral patterns concern the interactions between objects, defining how they communicate and collaborate. Examples include Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor patterns.

_Refactoring_ can be used to implement design patterns. 
While refactoring existing code to introduce a design pattern, developers often reorganize and modify the codebase 
to align it with the pattern's principles. 
As the project evolves, patterns may be identified, applied, and refined through refactoring to achieve design goals.

**In summary**, design patterns and refactoring work together to enhance software design, quality, and maintainability.
While design patterns offer structured solutions to common problems, refactoring serves as a means to continuously
improve code, align it with patterns, and adapt to changing requirements.
