# Task 1/2: What is Inline Variable refactoring?

We apply the **Inline refactoring** to simplify code by removing an unnecessary method or variable declarations and directly 
replacing them with their respective expressions or values.

Apply Inline Variable when a **variable is only used once** or when its name does not add any meaningful information. 
**If the variable does not contribute to code readability or logic, it can be inlined**.

To apply the Inline Method refactoring, select the code you want to inline and press the &shortcut:Inline; (macOS) or `Ctrl+Alt+N` (Windows/Linux) shortcut.
